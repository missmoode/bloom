  Packet definition has an identifier and a codec. Could possibly call it a "message domain", and then have protocol also be one.

  "messagehandlers" are registrations of a header number and a function which can decode the message.

  Protocol is a collection of packet definitions as well as handlers.

  each encoder has a domain key
  domain key is encoded before the message
  part of an object which has:
    - a domain key
    - a codec
    - a place to send decoded messages

  so maybe protocol.packetName.construct(packet) returns a buffer?
 Â¦
  Protocol should have the ability to create packet objects
  Separate receiving -- you create packet objects using the protocol when sending, and when receiving, the network manager will check a list of registered protocols

  protocol.createHandler(packet)? Somehow register a handler which informs the receiving code how to identify and decode the packet.
  Maybe *all* packets have an identity number, and the receiving code can use that to identify the packet.fg

makeCodec(TEST_PACKET).encode({ id: 1, blah: 'blah' }, new BufferConcatenator());

protocol.register(1, TEST_PACKET);
then register protocol with the network manager with an id. this registers each schema from the protocol alongside the protocol id and packet id in a map, generating a codec for it for later use.
network manager provides destination objects
destination.send(TEST_PACKET, { id: 1, blah: 'blah' });
destination instance passes along the destination details, as well as the schema and the object to the network manager. network manager then grabs the correct codec for the schema and encodes the protocol/packet id, and then the object into a buffer to send.
if the network manager can't find the codec for the schema, it throws an error. this ensures that the codecs are registered before sending, so that remote network managers running the same code are definitely set up to receive the packet.

could also include a validation phase of some sort before accepting a connection to a peer to ensure that the remote peer is using the same protocol. Maybe generate a checksum from all registered schemas, or from encoding predictable bogus data into every schema, and then compare the checksums.

protocol = [
  packet(id, schema),
]

could protocol just count as another packet wrapper?
{
  subprotocol(id, {
    
  }),
}
